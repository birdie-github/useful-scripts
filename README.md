# Probably useful scripts

## btc2usd
A shell script, which could also be used under XFCE via a generic monitor applet, to show the current bitcoin exchange rate in United States dollars (USD) fetched from CoinDesk. Requires a jq utility (can be installed in deb distros using `sudo apt-get install jq` or in RPM distros using `sudo yum install jq`).
